// while and do-while


// Both the while and do-while loops evaluate a condition and continue to loop as long as the condition 
//returns a value of true. The while loop evaluates the condition before the loop is executed.
// The do-while loop evaluates the condition after the loop is executed at least once. Let’s look at two
// examples that show how to use the while and do-while loops.
// In both examples, the askToOpen() method is called in the loop, executing logic that sets the
// isClosed variable as a bool value of true or false. Use the while loop if you already have enough
// information to evaluate the condition (isClosed) before the loop is executed. Use the do-while
// if you need to execute the loop first before you have enough information to evaluate the condition
// (isClosed).
// In the first example, you’ll use the while loop and iterate as long as the isClosed variable returns a
// value of true. In this case, the loop continues to execute as long as the isClosed variable is true and
// continues to loop. Once the isClosed variable returns false, the while stops from executing the
// next loop.
